# bmicalc-cpp-medium
A program that lets you calculate your own BMI automatically without the hassle of computing it manually.
A mini-project I made solely for the purpose of experimenting C++ itself using CodeBlocks.


features:
- Automatically converts your height and weight in BMI.
- The system will say if you are underweight, normal, overweight and etc.
- System will ask you if you want to try again.
- Many more (about).
